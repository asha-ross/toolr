User Stories:
1: "I am a mum of two teenagers, and have little time on my hands. I want to fix the door handle, and I want to learn to do it myself. I've got the YouTube video, but I don't want to buy the tools (I'd rather rent them). I need an app that is easy to navigate and takes me right to the tools I know the names of. I'm looking for afforability and ease of use."

2: "I am an amateur handyman with a garage full of tools I use only occasionaly. I want to make money from my skills, so I need an app to rent out my tools. I'm looking for the ability to upload a lot of different tools and keep track of those that are rented out."




Conflicts Resolution Plan – Toolr
– Andrew, Asha, Christy, Hope

1. Feedback and Communication
Regular Feedback: We will schedule regular feedback sessions during sprint meetings, held in the evenings, where we can discuss progress, challenges, and any concerns. This ensures that feedback is continuous and constructive.
Safe Space: We commit to maintaining an open and honest environment where everyone feels safe to share thoughts without judgement. This will help us address issues before they escalate.
2. Decision-Making Process
Collaborative Decisions: Decisions will be made collaboratively during our frequent sprint meetings. We’ll ensure that everyone's input is considered, balancing personal interests with the group’s goals.
Consensus Approach: When making decisions, we will strive for consensus, prioritising group interests and the MVP before personal stretch challenges.
3. Inclusion and Contribution
Pair Programming: To ensure everyone contributes effectively, we will do pair programming as early as possible, especially for the main functionality. This encourages collaboration and learning from each other.
Clarify Availability: We will clarify everyone’s availability early on to prevent hold-ups and ensure that tasks are assigned and completed efficiently.
4. Communication Routines
Frequent Sprint Meetings: These will be held in the evenings to discuss progress, work through errors, and plan the next steps. This will include using git checkout and asking for help when needed.
Development and Main Branches: We will use a development branch and merge to the main branch often, with the understanding that making mistakes is okay and part of the learning process.
5. Wellbeing and Breaks
Regular Check-ins: Wellbeing check-ins will be incorporated into our sprint meetings. These will be informal opportunities to share any personal needs or concerns.
6. Nonviolent Communication (NVC) Techniques
NVC Framework: We’ll express our needs and feelings without assigning blame. For example, if someone feels frustrated with a delay, they can express this by saying, “I feel concerned that this delay might impact our timeline. Can we discuss how to move forward?”
